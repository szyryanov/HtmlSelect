The widget requires [jQuery][jquery] library.

[jquery]: http://jquery.com

How to use:
-----------

1. Download the [widget package][distro]
2. Extract into an appropriate subdirectory on your site, e.g. "/widgets/myselect"
3. Add the jQuery library reference on your page, if not added yet
4. Add the widget script reference on your page

[distro]: http://szyryanov.github.io/Portfolio/HtmlSelect/files/myselect.zip "widget package"

For example:

        ... your page content ...
        <script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
        <script src="widgets/myselect/myselect.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

If you want to keep some `<select>` tag "as is", then add "myselect-skip" class to the tag (e.g. `<select class="myselect-skip">`).

If you want to see both the native widget and the customized one for some `<select>` tag, then add
"myselect-debug" class to the tag (e.g. `<select class="myselect-debug">`).

Source code:
------------

The widget source consists of 3 files:
* <code>HtmlSelect/widgets/myselect/[myselect.html][html]</code> - the widget HTML code
* <code>HtmlSelect/widgets/myselect/[myselect.css][css]</code> - the widget CSS code
* <code>HtmlSelect/widgets/myselect/[myselect.js][js]</code> - the widget JavaScript code

Limitations:
------------

The widget was not intended for real use but for education/training purpose. It replaces the `<select>` tag only. Any serious usage requires to customize other widgets too in order to make a consistent look (e.g. textbox, checkbox, radiobutton etc.).

So, the widget is ready to use, but with the following limitations:

* "multiple" (listbox-like) mode is not supported;
* `<optgroup>` feature is not supported;
* The original `<select>` tag positioning is not applied to the widget. You can wrap the `<select>` into `<span>` and apply the positioning to the `<span>` tag.
